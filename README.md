## Project Overview
The **Music Store Data Analysis** project utilizes SQL to explore and analyze data from a music store. The objective is to extract insights that can help the business make data-driven decisions, such as identifying the best customers, most popular genres, and optimal locations for promotions.

## Analysis Categories
The project is divided into three difficulty levels:

### 1. Easy

- Find countries with the most invoices.
- List the top three highest invoice totals.
- Determine the city with the highest revenue (for a potential music festival).
- Identify the best customer who has spent the most money.

### 2. Moderate
- Retrieve emails and names of rock music listeners, sorted alphabetically.
- List the top 10 artists/bands by the number of rock tracks.
- Identify tracks longer than the average song length, ordered by length.

### 3. Advanced

- Identify the most popular music genre for each country based on purchases.
- Determine the top-spending customer in each country.
